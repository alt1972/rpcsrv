A multi-threaded JSON-RPC server skeleton, based originally on the
Boost.Asio "server3" example code.  Currently implements a simple echo
server (params -> results), but sufficient code exists to support a
wide range of input and output.

Requires Boost 1.37.0 or later.

Building follows the familiar pattern:

	./autogen.sh	# only if building from git repo
	./configure
	make
	make install
