A multi-threaded JSON-RPC server skeleton, based originally on the
Boost.Asio "server3" example code.  Currently implements two simple
JSON-RPC methods, "ping" (always returns true) and "echo" (echoes
params back as the result), but sufficient code exists to support a
wide range of RPC methods, inputs and outputs.

Requires Boost 1.37.0 or later.

Building follows the familiar pattern:

	./autogen.sh	# only if building from git repo
	./configure
	make
	make install

Run "./rpcsrvd --help" for a summary of server configuration options,
and their default values.
